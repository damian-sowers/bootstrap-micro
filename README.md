Bootstrap Micro: A Stripe integrated marketplace for selling downloadable Bootstrap themes.

Note: I changed the demo to a site for free bootstrap resources, but the code is still here for selling downloadable website themes via stripe. 

See the demo: [http://www.bootstrapmicro.com/](http://www.bootstrapmicro.com/)
